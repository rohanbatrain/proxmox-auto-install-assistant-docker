# proxmox-auto-install-assistant-docker
The official Proxmox Automated Installer is only available for Debian-based systems — but what about Arch? This project packages the installer in a Docker container, making it usable on Arch Linux and other non-Debian distributions.  I needed this for my own Arch setup — so I built it. Now you can, too.
